# 👋 Hi, I’m Vidur

I’m a junior software developer working my way toward mid-level by building real-world projects, learning solid SDLC practices, and sharpening my problem-solving skills.  

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Languages & Frameworks**:  
  - C# / .NET 8 (Web API, EF Core, Hangfire)  
  - TypeScript / React / Next.js  
- **Frontend**: TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, TanStack Query  
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker  
- **Testing & Performance**: xUnit, k6, Playwright  
- **Other**: GitHub Actions, CI/CD, AWS basics  

## 🚀 Current Projects
- **[PricePulse](https://github.com/Vidurl16/PricePulse)**  
  A price tracker app (Amazon ZA → generic stores).  
  - Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind + TanStack  
  - Backend: ASP.NET Core + EF Core + Hangfire  
  - Infra: Docker Compose (Postgres + Redis)  
  - Goal: Build a full SDLC pipeline with CI, testing, and monitoring.  

## 🎯 Goals
- Level up from junior to mid-level by:  
  - Practicing **clean architecture** and **design patterns**.  
  - Building end-to-end projects with **real-world complexity**.  
  - Learning **system design** and **scalable architectures**.  
  - Writing better **tests**, improving debugging & investigation skills.  

## 📖 Learning Focus
- C# async patterns, DI lifetimes, and .NET backend architecture.
